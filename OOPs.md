# **Introduction to OOP in Java**
Java is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language.

## First, what is OOP?
    OOP is a programming paradigm based on "objects and classes" that allows the programmer to think about real-life objects.
    It makes the code cleaner, reusable, maintainable, and scalable.

## Benefits of (OOP).
    1. Improved productivity during software development.
    2. Improved software maintainability.
    3. Lower cost of development.
    4. Higher quality software.

## What Are Objects?
    An object is an entity that has states and behaviors.
    State tells us how the Object looks or what properties it has.
    Behavior tells us what the Object does.

    for example dog
    it has states like age, Name, Color, and so on
    and behaviors like eating, sleeping, and Running.

## What Are Classes?
    A class is a template from which objects created.

## OOP Principles.
    1. Inheritance.
    2. Encapsulation.
    3. Polymorphism.
    4. Abstraction.

## Inheritance.
    It is the mechanism in java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class.
    A class that inherits from another class can reuse the methods and fields of that class.

## Types of Inheritance in Java
    There are five types of inheritance in Java. They are single, multilevel, hierarchical, multiple, and hybrid.
## Example.

### Superclass.
"Animal" is a Parent class in which we created "name" and "color" variables and constructors.

### Sub-classes.
in Sub-classes "Dog" and "Cat" we created methods or behaviors of these classes.

### Main class and running example
in the main class, we initialized two objects from subclasses ans called it's methods.
